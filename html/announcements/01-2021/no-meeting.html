<p>The 115th Coquitlam Troop Section had a very good meeting this past Friday! All of the youth were able to successfully learn how safely to chop wood with an axe and hatchet.</p>

<p>Just a reminder that there will be no meetings on the fourth Friday of each month. This means that there will be <strong><span style="color: red">no meeting on Friday, January 29th</span></strong> and that our <strong>next meeting is on Friday, February 5th.</strong></p>

<p>See you then!</p>
