<p>Hope everyone enjoyed our first meeting of the year! For our meeting this Friday, we will be reviewing the procedure for starting our own campfires. Please bring your own pocket knives if you have one to help with making kindling.</p>

<p>We expect Venturers to take up a leadership role during this activity. There will be groups of 1-2 venturers leading a subset of scouts in building your own fires. If you need to brush up on your fire making skills, please do so prior to the meeting.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know.</p>
