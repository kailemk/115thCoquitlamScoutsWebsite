<p>As mentioned last week, there will be no regular meeting this Friday. We will be taking that time to plan the activities for the next month and beyond. As a reminder, Venturers are expected to attend the leader's meeting as well to further develop their planning and leadership skills.</p>

<p>Everyone stay safe and see you all in February!</p>
