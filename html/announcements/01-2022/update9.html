<p>Just a reminder that our regular meetings will resume this Friday, February 4th at the same place and same time.  We will be going over the core information on Scouting, as well as a safety overview on how to safely use a knife, hatchet, and ax.  Be sure to dress warmly for the cold weather.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
