<p>Scouts Canada has just informed our group that we are not permitted to hold our meetings at private residences at this time. This means that the location where we hold our meeting this week will have to change slightly.</p>

<p>For this week, we will be holding our meeting at Walton Park (which is right next to Pak's house). Since the park is right beside Pak's house, we will still meet there for drop-off and pick up. In addition, we will be doing shelter building instead of fire-starting this week.</p>

<p>As it will be really dark in the park, please bring a flashlight and/or headlight to the meeting. And as always, dress for the weather!</p>
