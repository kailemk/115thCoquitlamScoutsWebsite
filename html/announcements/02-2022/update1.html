<p>This is a reminder that we will be having a meeting this coming Friday. Our agenda for this meeting is to learn about knots for the purpose of building shelters. Both new and familiar knots will be covered, and will serve as preparation for our subsequent meeting. Please bring your own rope if you own one, while newcomers can borrow from group equipment. We plan to use the garage once again, so feel free to bring a camp chair to sit down while we work on our knots.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
