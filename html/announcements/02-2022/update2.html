<p>We hope everyone had a great weekend! Last meeting everyone had the chance to learn some new advanced knots. They will prove useful for everyone in the upcoming meeting, since we will be having a shelter building challenge. Please dress warm and water-resistant, as there will be a 100% chance of precipitation ðŸ˜‰ It will be optional to bring your own ropes.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
