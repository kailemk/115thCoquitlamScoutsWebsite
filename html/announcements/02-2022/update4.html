<p>For the first meeting in March, we plan for the scouts to do shelter building, while the venturers and cubs will begin working on a garden project. Be sure to dress warmly for the activities. Please bring your rope for those that are participating in the shelter building as they will be necessary for the activity.</p>

<p>As for camp, there are a few things to note for the upcoming March camp:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Those who are interested in coming to camp need to fill out the online form below before March 11.</li>
    <li><b>For all parents of Cubs or Scouts new to camping, please stay behind after our next meeting.</b> We will give a brief overview of what to expect from the camping experience and a crash course on the necessary gear for a safe and comfortable trip.</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting next week, please follow a detour path up Eskine St and loop back down Durant Dr for pick-up and drop-off. If parking is needed, please use the sections of Durant Dr and Walton Ave that borders the nearby park. See the attached image for reference. This policy will reduce the amount of congestion at the intersection and streamline the whole process. Thank you for your understanding!</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
