<p>Our next meeting will be on March 5. We will be learning how to operate propane and gas stoves to boil water and make hot chocolate. Please bring your OWN MUG; we will not be providing disposable cups, so you will miss out on the fun.</p>

<p>As usual, we will be meeting at Scouter Pak's house for pick up and drop off, and bring your flashlight and/or headlight.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
