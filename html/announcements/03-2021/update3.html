Hope you had a great weekend! We had a great time cooking some delicious hot dogs and learning how to start a fire!

Our next meeting will be taking place this week on March 19. We will be learning how to find and filter water in the wild and how to set up bear bags to prevent wildlife from eating our food during camps.

As usual, we will be meeting at Scouter Pak's house for pick up and drop off, and bring your flashlight and/or headlight.

See you there!
