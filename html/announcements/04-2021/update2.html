<p>Because we skipped a meeting on April 2nd to relax over Spring Break, there <strong>will</strong> be a meeting on April 23 to fulfill the 3 meeting quota for this month. As usual, we will meet at Scouter Pak's backyard, and we will all be making firestarters to add to your collection. <strong><span style="color: red">Please bring your own small/medium sized ziploc bag</span></strong>, because one of the firestarters will be a little messy and hard to prepare without one.</p>

<p>In addition, <strong><span style="color: red">please bring your revised first aid kit</span></strong> if you forgot to during our last meeting!</p>
    
<p>See you there!</p>
