<p>Our next meeting will be on Friday May 7th and we will be learning how to make our own survival slingshots. We will be providing all the materials that the scouts will need to make their own survival slingshots!</p>

<p>As usual, we will be meeting at Scouter Pak's house for pickup and dropoff.</p>

<p>We will also be discussing with the scouts a hike sometime near the end of May which we will have a notice coming out soon.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
