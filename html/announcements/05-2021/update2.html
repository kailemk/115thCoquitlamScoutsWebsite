<p>Hope everyone had fun making their shepherd slings last meeting. If you've forgotten how to make our simple sling, or want to learn an advanced design, please see the links.</p>

<p>As for the coming meeting, we will be learning how to properly sharpen our knives. We will provide the sanding stones, but you will need to bring your own knives. As always, dress for the weather, and we will meet at Scouter Pak's house.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
