<p>Hope you all enjoyed learning how to sharpen pocket knives last week.</p> 

<p>This upcoming week, we will be learning how to start a campfire with charcoal and then making smores after the fires have been started! We will be providing all the materials!</p>

<p>As usual, we will be meeting at Scouter Pak's house for pick up and drop off.</p>

<p>A reminder to also sign up for our upcoming hike on May 30th!</p>
