<p>Hope everyone enjoyed the hike, we all had a lot of fun!</p> 

<p>For this upcoming meeting on Friday, June 4, we will be focused on first aid so we will be learning how to apply triangular bandages, tension bandages and practice making stretchers.</p> 

<p>We ask that all the scouts please bring their neckerchiefs for some of the activities.</p> 

<p>As usual, we will be meeting at Scouter Pak's house for pick up and drop off.</P>
