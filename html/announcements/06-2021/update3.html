<p>Hope y'all are enjoying the sun and the warm weather!</p>

<ol>
    <li>Just a reminder that there will be no meeting on Friday, June 25th.</li>
    <li>We will be having our next meeting on Friday, July 2nd. Starting this year, Scouts Canada is offering a year round program and our group will be continuing our Friday meetings in the summer during the same time.</li>
    <li>As provincial health orders regarding COVID 19 continue to evolve, our group will continue to act with guidance from BC health orders and regulations from Scouts Canada. We will share updates as soon as we get them.</li>
    <li>The provincial health order for overnight camps has been lifted as of June 7th. We are still waiting for guidance from our local scout council regarding how to proceed with camps, but the hope is for our group to have two camping trips this summer, one in late July and one sometime in August. Of course, there will be COVID protocols and a COVID safety operating plan in place to ensure everyone at camp feels comfortable. More details will hopefully be shared soon!</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks, and see you all in July!</p>
