<p>Hope everyone had a good Canada Day weekend. We have a few points to go over in this post.</p>
<ol>
    <li>For our next meeting, we will be planning a section-wide project that some of the Scouts who have not completed their Chief Scouts Award will be able to use to obtain their award. We will have more details regarding this project after this upcoming meeting.</li>
    <li>We are planning to have a camping trip for the weekend of July 23 - July 25. The camp notice can be accessed below and contains all the relevant information regarding the camp along with all of the COVID safety protocols that will be implemented during our camping trip. Please sign up using the form and we will be accepting payments during the next two meetings.</li>
    <li>Update on COVID protocols during meetings. Thank you to the parents who have filled out our COVID protocol waiver, the leaders have taken the time to go over your responses and have come up with the following plan in accordance with the rules set by the province and by Scouts Canada. We understand that everyone has their own level of comfortability with the easing of COVID restrictions in BC that were announced on July 1st so here are the steps that we will be implementing
        <ul>
            <li>Masks will be mandatory for the remaining meetings during the month of July. 
            <li>Starting the first meeting of August, masks will no longer be mandatory but will instead be optional, up to the decision of the Scout and their parents.</li>
            <li>All meetings will continue to take place in an outdoor location.</li>
            <li>Hand sanitizer will continue to be provided for all meetings.</li>
            <li>We continue to ask that if any youth feel sick or are experiencing COVID like symptoms, to please remain at home.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any questions regarding any of the topics above, please feel free to send us an email. If not, we will see you all on Friday!</p>
