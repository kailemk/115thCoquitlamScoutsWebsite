<p>The Scouts have designed a shelf to build in Scouter Pak's backyard and we are trying to figure out the dates and times we are going to build it. Please fill out the Shelf Building Availability Survey so we know when everyone has the time to work on constructing and completing this project.</p>

<p>Working on this project will be a great learning experience for everyone involved, so please complete the survey so that we work on this project when everyone is available. Each Scout is expected to participate in at least one timeslot, since this project is a team project that will benefit the group as a whole. More details can be found in the form.</p>

<p>There will be no more meetings for the rest of the month because of this project and the upcomingÂ camp.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and help, and we look forward to seeing you at camp or the next meeting!</p>
