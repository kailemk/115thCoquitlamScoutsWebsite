<p>A quick reminder that there will be no regular meetings for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>For those registered to camp, we will see you on Friday July 23 at the Golden Ears parking lot.</p>

<p>For the week of July 26, the Scouts will be constructing enhancements to our shelf storage as a group. Everyone should have received a survey email this past weekend to schedule the project. Please remember to fill out that survey as soon as possible so we can determine what day(s) the Scouts can come together to build the shelf.</p>

<p>Take care, and we'll see you soon!</p>
