<p>Thank you for completing the availability survey regarding the Shelf Building Project. Unfortunately not everyone will be available to participate on the same dates, so we have scheduled everyone to join different time slots. Check your email to find out what time slot you have been assigned in.</p>

<p>Rest assured that every Scout will be contributing a significant amount of work regardless of the other Scouts present.</p>

<p>Dinner and beverages will be provided for the participants.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and help, and we look forward to seeing you when we work on completing this project!</p>

<p>P.S. We are already planning another exciting camp for the third weekend of August. Stay tuned for more details!</p>
