<p>We want to first congratulate the scouts on working together to build a storage shelf from scratch.  They worked well as a team and created a very functional product in the end.  Give yourselves a pat on the back!</p>

<p>For this week, we will have a meeting that involves cooking.  That means the scouts need to bring some kitchen utensils such as a bowl and a fork + spoon to eat with.</p>

<p>A reminder that starting this upcoming meeting, our Scout group is moving onto modified COVID protocols for meetings and outings. As per the protocols from Scouts Canada and the provincial government, masks will no longer be required during our meetings but will instead be made optional, up to the discretion of the scout and parents on whether they would like to wear a mask at meetings. We ask that parents and scouts continue to monitor themselves for any signs of COVID related symptoms and that if any symptoms are present then to please let us know and to please stay home. We would like to add that at this point, all of the Scouters have been fully vaccinated.</p> 

<p>Also another reminder for those that haven't signed up for this month's scout camp to do so. It runs from Aug.19th to Aug.22nd, with various activities that the scouts will enjoy! Click on the link below to go to the sign up form.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there at the meeting on Friday!</p>
