<p>We hope the Scouts enjoyed learning new recipes last week, because we will be learning how to cook a one-pot Beef Stroganoff this week! Once again, please bring your own eating utensils to enjoy your own cooking; the equipment and ingredients will be provided.</p>

<p>We'd also like to remind everyone that our registration deadline for camp is this Thursday, August 12 @11:59pm. Please bring camp fees to the meeting this week. Ivan and Howard will be in charge of purchasing the Scout's meals for this camp; we will work out a time and date to do the shopping at the end of this week's meeting.</p>

<p>Feel free to email us any questions or concerns regarding camp. See you soon!</p>
