<p>We had some exciting events during this summer, but it is coming to a close soon. As such, this email will update everyone on our plans going into the fall season.</p>

<p>First off, as with every other month, we will not have any more meetings in the month of August. Most of you have tents and other equipment from our recent camp, so please hold on to those and return them on September 3rd.</p>

<p>Speaking of equipment, we would like to schedule either the 4th or 5th of September for the Scouts to clean our group equipment together. There are many pieces of gear that need a good scrubbing after two camps, and we want as many participants as possible to help. More details to be announced shortly.</p>

<p>Starting this September, all scouts and scouters will be required to wear their uniforms to each meeting; old and new uniforms are acceptable. If you do not own a suitable uniform, please let us know so we can put in an order for you.</p>

<p>As for upcoming events, we are planning a camp for October. We have not decided on a date just yet, but we are looking at the Thanksgiving weekend from the 9th to the 11th, more details coming in the next couple weeks.</p>

<p>That's all for the update! Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>See you in September!</p>

<p>P.S. Check your email for some of the photos we took from our last camp!</p>
