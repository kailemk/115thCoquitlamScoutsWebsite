<p>We hope everyone enjoyed the remainder of summer! Our next scouts meeting will be on September 3. We will be doing three things: designing a new crest for our group; adding a small safety enhancement to our newly built shelf; and begin cleaning some of the group's equipment.</p>

<p>Please remember that starting from now, all scouts and scouters will be required to be in uniform for weekly meetings.</p>

<p>As for the separate day for cleaning equipment, we will postpone that for a week for now, since the weather forecast predicts high probability of rain over the coming weekend.</p>

<p>Please let us know if you have any questions!</p>
