<p>Because it has been so long since we last wore uniforms, some scouts may no longer fit in the ones you have. If you need to purchase a new one, please send us your child's measurements and we can help submit an order for you. Take a look at the attached sizing chart for the correct method of taking measurements. The final price of each uniform should be between $35 and $40 after tax, depending on the size ordered.</p></p>

<p>Please note that because of some issues on the Scout Shop website, the sizes XS, S, and M no longer exist. Our order will be delayed until those issues are resolved, and you may not receive the uniform as soon as expected.</p>

<p>Those that were measured at the last meeting do not need to send an additional email, your orders have been recorded.</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any questions, and have a great weekend!</p>
