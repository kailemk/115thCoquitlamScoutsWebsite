<p>Our next meeting will be focused on learning about the principles of old stove and lanterns, as well as creating a meal plan for camp that we're planning for October. Please bring some pencil and paper to write down your meal ideas.

<p>Registration for the next scouting year is now open. Everyone should have received an email from Ruby regarding how to renew their registration for next year. Let us know if you didn't receive that email and we can resend it to you.</p>

<p>We will be having try out sessions on September 10th and 17th. If you have any friends or family that are interested in joining our group, please have them email Ruby at rubypyk@gmail.com to register.</p>

<p>In addition, here's a quick reminder to send us your child's measurements if you require new uniforms. Please see our previous email for full details.</p>

<p>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>See you next week!</p>
