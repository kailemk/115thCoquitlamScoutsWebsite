<p></p>We are planning to schedule Saturday, September 11 from 2:00pm to 6:00pm to clean and organize our group equipment. The weather channel forecast for that day seems to be favorable, but it may be subject to change in the next couple days. We will reassess the forecast on Thursday and lock in the date.</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any questions.</p>
