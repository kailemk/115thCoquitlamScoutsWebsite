<p>We have reviewed the weather forecast for this Saturday, September 11. Despite there being a chance of rain, there will only be minimal rain even if it does. We plan to clean as much as we can while the weather holds. Please be there at 2:00pm and we will clean until 6:00pm as planned. Bring your own water and snacks if needed.</p>

<p>Quick reminder that we will have a meeting tonight. See you there!</p>
