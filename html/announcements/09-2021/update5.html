<p>We hope everyone had a relaxing weekend! This Friday, we will be constructing a catapult out of sticks and ropes. First we will plan out a rough design, and then applyour knot tying skills to construct it. Our storage should have enough ropes for the project, but feel free to bring your own ropes as well.</p> 

<p>As for our October camp, here is the registration form. Please remember to fill it out by the deadline on October 1, and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
