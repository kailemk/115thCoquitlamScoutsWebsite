<p>The deadline to sign up for our Thanksgiving Camp is in less than a week on October 1st, so don't forget to register! You can find our camp form below.</p>

<p>Scouts Canada has provided an update to their safety policies regarding COVID-19. As of November 1st, all scouts and scouters must be FULLY VACCINATED and must update their status on the myscouts.ca website accordingly. If you have not gotten the full vaccination by that time, you are not permitted to participate in any scouting activities. In the case your child is under 12 and is scheduled to get vaccinated, you will still be permitted to attend activities. For further information, please visit the link below for a list of FAQs. If your child(ren) are already fully vaccinated, please bring your vaccination passports sometime during the October meetings so that we can record your status. This way we have documentation of your vaccination status even if you have not updated your profile on myscouts.</p>

<p>Our last update is that we plan to sell Scouts Coffee to raise funds for our equipment and camps. We will NOT be going door to door or go out in public spaces for this campaign, as we want to minimize contact with potential COVID carriers. Instead, we will be relying on sales to everyone's friends and family. Remember that this fundraiser benefits our group greatly, so everyone do your best to find all the coffee lovers you know!</p>

<p>That wraps up our updates for October. Let us know if you have any questions!</p>
