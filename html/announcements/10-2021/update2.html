<p>Hi Campers!</p>

<p>After our short discussion on everyone's availability, we decided we will be shopping for camp food from 6:30 - 8:30pm on Wednesday @ Superstore (3000 Lougheed Hwy, Coquitlam). Please bring any reusable shopping bags if you have any, as you will need to distribute the food amongst yourselves.</p>

<p>If you become unavailable for that time, let us know and we can reschedule.</p>
