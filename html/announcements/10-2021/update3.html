<p>Reminder to everyone that since we're hosting a camp from Oct.8th to Oct.11th, there will be no meeting this week.  Instead, the next in-person meeting will be on Oct.15th.  If you are coming to camp, we'll see you there.  Otherwise, we'll see the rest of you in 2 weeks.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy your Thanksgiving weekend however you choose to celebrate it!</p>
