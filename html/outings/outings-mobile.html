                <li>Camps have always been one of the largest components of Scouting and camping is always something that Scouts look forward to, however, due to the current provincial health order from Dr. Bonnie Henry, overnight camps for youth are not allowed, so our camps will have to be suspended until the health order is lifted </li>
                <li>Day outings are allowed however, so we will be planning hikes and other outdoor outings for the Scouts this upcoming fall.</li>
                <li>We will send out an outing schedule to parents as soon as we have finalized all of our outings with our group commissioner.</li>
