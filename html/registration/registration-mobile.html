            <p>Memberships expire at the end of the Scouting year and must be renewed at that time. Scouts Canada usually sends an email close to the membership expiration date that provides instructions to how existing members can renew their registration. This process usually involves completing forms on <a href="https://www.myscouts.ca/">myScouts</a>. Those who do not renew their registration before the given deadline may have to apply to join the group as a new member by following the instructions in the previous section.</p>
