We are quickly approaching the month of December and that means that our biggest camp of the year is coming up! Christmas Camp 2019 is set to take place December 13-15 at Camp Whonnock. 
Since this is a large group event, we will only be offering the paper notice and not the online registration link. Please see the attached notice for further details and please register and return the notice by December 5th. Camp Whonnock has a maximum capacity and signup is on a first come first serve basis. This is a camp that you won't want to miss! A message to pass along from our group administrator regarding some late registrations, we have had great registration numbers for our events but we have noticed that there have been some very late registrations for our recent events and we hope everyone can respect the deadlines on the notices, it greatly helps the scouters plan the amount of food, materials, and make corresponding arrangements for the number of people attending the events.
Thank you very much and see you all on Thursday!
